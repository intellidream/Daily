The update first shipped in September, but its rollout is being done gradually. Now, users can elect to receive the update.</p><p>Here's what Microsoft said in its updated document:</p><p><em>"</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aka.ms/how-to-get-25H2" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>Windows 11, version 25H2</strong></em></u></a><em> is now available to all eligible Windows 11 devices for users who have turned on the setting </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/get-windows-updates-as-soon-as-they-re-available-for-your-device-cad7b32b-001e-435b-9110-f18309b54168" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>Get the latest updates as soon as they’re available</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em><em> If you have an eligible Windows 10 or Windows 11 device, you can check if the update is available by selecting </em><em><strong>Settings > Windows Update</strong></em><em> and selecting </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/windows/update-windows-3c5ae7fc-9fb6-9af1-1984-b5e0412c556a" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>Check for updates</strong></em></u></a><em>.

Systems on Windows 11 version 24H2 (Home or Pro) are part of the rollout.</p><p>You don't have to do anything to receive Windows 11 version 25H2 later down the line. Eligible PCs will be upgraded automatically. But you can make the jump earlier by choosing to get updates as soon as they are available.</p><p>Windows 11 version 25H2 does not include any new features. There are new Windows 11 features shipping to PCs this year, but they arrive in the form of cumulative updates and are available for both Windows 11 version 25H2 and 24H2.</p><p>It's also important to keep systems up to date for security.</p><p>Our expert Mauro Huculak rounded up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/best-features-microsoft-rolled-out-in-2025-for-windows-11-versions-25h2-and-24h2">best features Microsoft rolled out in 2025 for Windows 11 versions 25H2 and 24H2</a> recently in case you need to catch up on everything new for Windows 11 this year.</p><p>You can also download an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsofts-official-windows-11-version-25h2-rtm-iso-media-is-now-available-download-all-28-languages-here-for-x64-or-arm64">official Windows 11 version 25H2 ISO</a> or follow our guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/how-to-force-the-windows-11-2025-update-version-25h2-on-your-pc">how to force the Windows 11 2025 Update on your PC</a>.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The news outlet claimed that ChatGPT used its content without compensation or authorization.</p><p>However, OpenAI has sought to dismiss the lawsuit by arguing that scraping online content to train AI models qualifies as fair use. Until recently, OpenAI has had the last laugh in court. In 2024, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-beats-copyright-infringement-lawsuit">New York federal judge recently dismissed a copyright infringement lawsuit filed against OpenAI</a> by news outlets, including Raw Story and AlterNet.</p><p>The judge indicated that the plaintiffs didn't establish where the AI firm sourced its content, and that it potentially then used the scraped data to train ChatGPT without compensation.</p><p>OpenAI was recently compelled to produce 20 million chat logs from ChatGPT users in its ongoing court battle with the New York Times, in a case before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ona Wang in Manhattan (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/openai-loses-fight-keep-chatgpt-logs-secret-copyright-case-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>).</p><div><blockquote><p>Let us be clear about what is really at stake here. The alleged injury for which Plaintiffs truly seek redress is not the exclusion of CMI but the use of Plaintiffs' articles to develop ChatGPT without compensation. Whether there is another statute or legal theory that does elevate this type of harm remains to be seen. But that question is not before the Court today.</p><p> New York Federal Judge, Colleen McMahon</p></blockquote></div><p>While OpenAI previously argued that this was a huge ask that would <em>"disregard long-standing privacy protections,"</em> the judge indicated that the logs were important to establish the outlets' claims. Wang further indicated that producing the logs wouldn't violate ChatGPT users' privacy. <em>"There are multiple layers of protection in this case precisely because of the highly sensitive and private nature of much of the discovery," </em>the judge added.</p><p>OpenAI has already filed an appeal to wiggle its way out of Wang's order to produce 20 million chat logs to the presiding judge, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein.</p><p>In the past, OpenAI CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-admits-needs-copyright-materials-for-chatgpt">Sam Altman argued that copyright law doesn't categorically prohibit</a> the use of copyrighted content for training AI models. Interestingly, the executive admitted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-admits-needs-copyright-materials-for-chatgpt">that developing ChatGPT-like tools without copyrighted content is virtually impossible</a>.</p><p>MediaNews Group executive editor Frank Pine indicated that OpenAI's leadership was <em>"hallucinating when they thought they could get away with withholding evidence about how their business model relies on stealing from hardworking journalists."</em></p><p>It'll be interesting to see how the court case pans out, especially following recent reports suggesting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/openai-google-and-anthropic-hit-the-critical-knowledge-cap-for-advanced-ai-training-is-agi-still-in-the-chatgpt-makers-pipeline-in-the-next-five-years">top AI labs might be unable to advance AI models</a> due to a lack of high-quality training content amid plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-chatgpt/chatgpt-code-suggests-ads">inject ads into ChatGPT</a>.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Perhaps more interestingly, we're seeing Linux gain popularity, presumably at least in part to its lack of ads and telemetry tracking.</p><p>OpenAI is arguably the most sought-after and well-established AI research lab. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella argued that this can be attributed to its 2-year runway, which allowed it to build and develop ChatGPT uncontested.</p><p>But as it now seems, the AI firm might be on the precipice of throwing all these efforts into the water. Over the past few weeks, numerous reports have emerged detailing OpenAI's plans to integrate ads into ChatGPT (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/ai-platforms-assistants/chatgpt/the-era-of-ads-in-chatgpt-begins-users-furious-as-even-usd200-a-month-pro-subscribers-hit-with-app-suggestions" target="_blank">Tech Radar</a>).</p><p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman previously dismissed ChatGPT ads as a last resort for generating revenue. But he didn't completely shut that door either. <em>"I'm not saying OpenAI would never consider ads, but I don't like them in general, and I think that 'ads-plus-</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence"><em>AI</em></a><em>' is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,"</em> added Altman.</p><p>Ads in ChatGPT seem imminent as new code suggests that the company is already internally testing them in the chatbot.</p><h2 id="chatgpt-users-can-t-entertain-the-thoughts-of-ads-2">ChatGPT users can't entertain the thoughts of ads</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="GVRWgA3QTtiQVSHcAWZg3H" name="ChatGPT logo and app." alt="A photo taken on November 27, 2024 shows the logo of the ChatGPT application developed by US artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI on a smartphone screen (L) and the letters AI on a laptop screen in Frankfurt am Main, western Germany.

However, investors have raised concerns about the billions of dollars invested in the ever-evolving technology without a clear profitability path.</p><p>Concerningly, a damning report claimed that there's no clear path for OpenAI to profitability through 2030. And even if it manages to keep its operations afloat during this period, it'll still need to invest an additional $207 billion to ascertain its sustainability.</p><p>It was only a matter of time till OpenAI considered integrating ads into ChatGPT. Reports suggest that the company is already burning through money. For context, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-chatgpt/microsoft-obscures-openais-usd11-5-billion-loss">OpenAI might have lost $11.5 billion</a> chasing AI hype, according to Microsoft's financial report for the fiscal year ending June 30.</p><p>According to recent reports, the AI firm generates up to $13 billion annually from ChatGPT and LLM access fees. However, OpenAI CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-chatgpt/100-billion-for-openai-by-2027-sam-altman-ipo">Sam Altman projects that the figure could skyrocket to $100 billion by 2027</a>. It seems highly unlikely that the company could cover its exorbitant expenses from the revenue it generates. This could only make sense if ChatGPT ads join the fold.</p><p>What puzzles me is that the company might even integrate ChatGPT ads for users with paid subscription plans. Absurdly, some users with a $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription have already started sharing screenshots of ads appearing in their user interfaces while interacting with the chatbot.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ChatGPT has started posting ads on Pro accounts.I hope this is just testing/a mistake, else it's an instant unsubscribe from me.

However, he admitted that <em>"the lack of relevancy makes it a bad/confusing experience". </em>It seems that the company is iterating on suggestions and the US in ChatGPT, in an attempt to improve the experience.</p><p>Be it as it may, ads have no place in ChatGPT based on the sentiments and backlash shared by users across social media. However, it feels like a necessary evil to keep OpenAI's operations going.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1pdpono/the_era_of_ads_in_chatgpt_begins_users_furious_as/">one Redditor</a>:</p><p><em>"Right now Chat GPT needs to increase its revenue by about 9x to break even, it can only exist now thanks to companies dumping billions into this technology. </em></p><p><em>Unless someone suddenly invents cold fusion power or GPUs that last forever, there is no possi le way for them to ever turn a profit unless they drastically increase the price of their services and flood it with ads.

Early this month, Giorgio Sardo, Vice President of the Microsoft Store, shared the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/12/03/announcing-the-microsoft-store-awards-2025-winners/" target="_blank">Microsoft Store Awards 2025 winners</a>.</p><p>Feedback on the winners has been largely negative from what I've seen. There are some confusing entries on the list, including a free-to-play game that came out in 2024.</p><p>Several people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/WithinRafael/status/1996326158435295280?s=20">took to X</a> to complain about the list. The winners also surprised all my coworkers that I shared the list with — and not in a good way.</p><p>The majority of the apps use AI to some extent, which is hardly a surprise. Microsoft has added AI to everything from Notepad to Microsoft 365, so it's clear the tech giant values artificial intelligence within applications.</p><p>Surprisingly, Microsoft did not accept nominations for the Microsoft Store Awards. The tech giant has sought feedback from the community for quite some time, but it went in a different direction in 2025.</p><h2 id="microsoft-store-awards-2025-winners-2">Microsoft Store Awards 2025 winners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3638px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ogEwTHSMLS5owQ5vK25oBN" name="GettyImages-2150483357" alt="An image of a woman holding a laptop in front of a ChatGPT logo displayed on a computer screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ogEwTHSMLS5owQ5vK25oBN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3638" height="2047" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">ChatGPT is one of two AI assistants to win Microsoft Store awards in 2025. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Getty Images | NurPhoto )</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li>AI Assistant: <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/XP8JNQFBQH6PVF"><u><strong>Perplexity</strong></u></a><strong> by Perplexity AI</strong></li><li>AI Assistant: <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nt1r1c2hh7j"><u><strong>ChatGPT</strong></u></a><strong> by OpenAI</strong></li><li>Business: <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9WZDNCRDCHR8"><u><strong>Invoice Maker & Estimate Creator by Moon Invoice</strong></u></a><strong> by Moon Technolabs Pvt.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=windowscentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Windows Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/how-to-choose-websites-that-show-up-in-google-search-on-chrome-edge-or-firefox"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>When you think of the storied game developer Rare these days, you probably think of its acclaimed live-service Xbox title <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/sea-thieves" target="_blank">Sea of Thieves</a>, or perhaps its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-cancellations-july-2025" target="_blank">infamously canceled</a> action-adventure game Everwild. But many years ago, the studio also created the beloved 3D platformer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/banjo-kazooie" target="_blank">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, a series that follows the wacky adventures of brown bear Banjo and his backpack-riding avian companion named — you guessed it — Kazooie.</p><p>Like Super Mario 64 before it, the original 1998 Banjo-Kazooie is widely considered to be a genre-defining classic, and its sequels Banjo-Tooie and Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge are acclaimed as well. 2008's experimental Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts controversially shifted the gameplay focus to vehicle construction, however, and was met with a more mixed reception.</p><p>Tragically, Rare hasn't made a new Banjo-Kazooie game since, and with the developer still focusing on making Sea of Thieves content, it's unclear if we'll ever<em> </em>see it build one under Xbox Game Studios. But as it turns out, there's actually a new Banjo-Kazooie game you can play right now! ... Sort of.</p><p>That game is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://indreams.me/dream/mSFcdDKSMkr" target="_blank">Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania</a>, a fan-made title created by a tiny team using the 2020 PlayStation game-making tool Dreams. It's available to play now through Dreams for free, as all user-created content on it is, though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-PlayStation-4/dp/B082LW28B2" target="_blank">Dreams itself is $20</a> (it's also on PlayStation Plus). You can watch the trailer for it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTFO07PsYw0" target="_blank">here</a> or below.</p><p>Sadly, Dreams never got a port to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, or Windows PC, so you won't be able to check Mumbomania out if you don't have a PS5 or PS4. Still, the game looks terrific, and you should absolutely check it out if you own one of Sony's consoles.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xTFO07PsYw0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania features one massive singular tropical island level with 30 "jiggy" (think Super Mario 64 stars) puzzle pieces to collect; the original game had 100, to provide a comparison. In addition to Banjo and Kazooie, it also introduces Mumbo, a colorful disembodied skull that floats around and helps "collect, fight, and transform into a variety of strange beings."</p><p>As you'd expect, you can jump, roll, and punch with Banjo, and fly or shoot eggs with Kazooie. Mumbo, meanwhile, is able to fetch certain items in the environment for you, and can transform Banjo into animated versions of objects like giant boulders or cannons that give you access to unique abilities.</p><p>A full playthrough will take you about an hour or so, and completionists aiming to find every collectible and solve every puzzle can expect a playtime double that.</p><p>I wouldn't even question it if you told me this was an official release from Rare and not a Dreams fan game; clearly, a ton of work went into making Mumbomania feel as authentically Banjo-Kazooie as possible. In fact, director William "Eupholace" Butkevicius noted that it took "About 14 months" and "800+ hours of work" to finish, and all of that invested time and effort shows.</p><p>Contributing alongside him was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Piece_of_Craft" target="_blank">PieceofCraft</a> who handled the game's animations and scripting logic, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thegamebrass" target="_blank">The Game Brass</a> who created Mumbomania's upbeat, high-energy soundtrack.</p><h2 id="where-is-xbox-s-answer-to-dreams-2">Where is Xbox's answer to Dreams?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GwxqpfvxnNKfYU6DKE3JqR" name="mumbomania-screenshot" alt="Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GwxqpfvxnNKfYU6DKE3JqR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Someone has now made a Banjo-Kazooie game in Dreams that's nigh-indistinguishable from an official entry from Rare. There's nothing like this on Xbox. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: William "Eupholace" Butkevicius)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The release of Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania is a remarkable achievement for the passionate, talented fans of the franchise that made it. With that said, I can't help but feel rather bittersweet about its arrival, as it's a painful reminder that Microsoft, Xbox, and Rare (update: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1996700287466143976?s=20" target="_blank">Rare has tipped its hat to Mumbomania</a>) have sat on this franchise for upwards of <em>20 years </em>without developing a new entry in it.</p><p>Astro Bot winning Game of the Year in 2024 was a strong reminder that the market for platformers is as strong as ever, and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/microsoft-and-xbox-need-to-start-reinvesting-in-platformers" target="_blank">Xbox really needs to invest in creating some</a>. Perhaps Crash Bandicoot and Spyro developer Toys for Bob will make a new Banjo-Kazooie; after all, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/since-going-independent-of-activision-microsoft-and-xbox-studio-toys-for-bob-says-theyd-love-to-work-on-a-banjo-kazooie-in-a-new-interview" target="_blank">the studio said it would love to</a> in the wake of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-studio-toys-for-bob-is-going-independent-may-explore-future-partnerships-with-xbox" target="_blank">its departure from Xbox to independence</a>, as it was notably exploring a partnership opportunity despite exiting Xbox Game Studios.</p><p>Regardless, Mumbomania's exclusive availability on PS5 and PS4 due to Dreams' PlayStation exclusivity also highlights the fact there's really nothing like Dreams on Xbox, or even on PC for that matter.</p><p>Games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/battlefield-6" target="_blank">Battlefield 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/halo-infinite" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> have powerful creation tools like Portal and Forge, sure, but even those are quite limited in comparison. Mumbomania is nigh-indistinguishable from an official Banjo-Kazooie game, and that's not something I could make in Battlefield or Halo.</p><p>Ultimately, it's a cruel irony that Xbox owns Banjo-Kazooie, yet the best (and only) Banjo-Kazooie experience we've gotten since 2008 is only playable if you're on PlayStation. And because there's not a Dreams-like game on Microsoft's console, Xbox fans can't even make one of their own.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2f5441bc-ce5c-4a30-8d57-76e35922fc4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dreams | $19.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Dreams | $19.99 at Amazon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:316px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="97EYR6gK6RdgU9oddhqXvC" name="dreams-square-pic" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/97EYR6gK6RdgU9oddhqXvC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="316" height="316" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Dreams | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-PlayStation-4/dp/B082LW28B2" target="_blank" data-dimension112="2f5441bc-ce5c-4a30-8d57-76e35922fc4c" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Dreams | $19.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Dreams | $19.99 at Amazon" data-dimension25=""><strong>$19.99 at Amazon</strong></a><br><br>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania is playable exclusively through Dreams — the PlayStation-exclusive game creation tool that was used to make it.

It's Keeper, carefully optimized and refined to look its absolute best in black-and-white, and it's the headlining feature of this update.</p><p>That's not <em>all</em> we got, though. Double Fine also optimized the game further to enable ultrawide monitor support for PC players, letting Keeper go double wide to more efficiently blast your eye holes with the most magnificent vistas you couldn't begin to imagine.</p><p>Below are some awfully convenient side-by-side comparisons I made, so you can get a good look at Noir Mode and ultrawide support in Keeper.</p><iframe allow="" height="280" width="100%" id="" style="" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=18772844-d14f-11f0-ba1b-0e6f42328d7d"></iframe><iframe allow="" height="280" width="100%" id="" style="" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=29fb2822-d14f-11f0-ba1b-0e6f42328d7d"></iframe><iframe allow="" height="280" width="100%" id="" style="" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/juxtapose/latest/embed/index.html?uid=35de360c-d14f-11f0-ba1b-0e6f42328d7d"></iframe><p>Looks pretty good, right?

Accessibility improvements are always welcome, and Keeper now has a range of options for highlighting objects, creatures, interactable elements, and more.

Total War: Medieval 3 notably marks the first time one of these sub-series (outside of Warhammer) has received a third entry. <br><br>You can watch the announcement trailer below:</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The developers note that Total War: Medieval 3 is currently in early pre-production, and players shouldn't expect it to launch anytime soon. The game is being revealed early on in order for the team to share behind-the-scenes details and ask for community feedback as the development process continues.</p><h2 id="a-new-engine-for-new-games-2">A new engine for new games</h2><p>Total War: Medieval 3 is also being developed using an upgraded version of the Total War engine. Referred to as Warcore, this new version of the engine is meant to provide a better technological foundation for the future, with examples of better physics and more impressive pathfinding. <br><br>Perhaps most importantly, this engine upgrade allows Total War games to launch on Xbox and PlayStation consoles. The developers insist that the games will still be developed with PC in mind as the main focus, but the option will now be open for the future. <br><br>It's not clear at this time if that means Total War: Medieval 3 will be available on Xbox and PlayStation, so we'll have to wait to find out.</p><h2 id="more-total-war-to-come-2">More Total War to come</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1278px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="GAuUCdtEfnnas2uMyS2orF" name="total-war-warhammer-3-lords-of-the-end-times-announce" alt="Total War: Warhammer 3 Lords of the End Times DLC announce" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAuUCdtEfnnas2uMyS2orF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1278" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Lords of the End Times brings Nagash to Total War: Warhammer 3 in 2026. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sega)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of the improved engine and Medieval 3, players can look forward to the Lords of the End Times DLC for Total War: Warhammer 3, which is unleashing Nagash and the titular End Times event in Summer 2026.<br><br>There is still more Total War to come, and Creative Assembly closed out the showcase by confirming that <em>another</em> new game is being announced during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/game-awards-2025">Game Awards 2025</a>, which is set to kick off on<strong> Dec. 11, 2025 at 4:30 p.m. PT / 7:30 p.m. ET. </strong><br><br>What game will it be?

This is what's soon happening with Stranger Things, one of Netflix's biggest TV shows that just premiered the first episode of Season 5 — and it's coming to the last Xbox game you'd expect it to.</p><p>The game in question is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/microsoft-flight-simulator" target="_blank">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, the sequel to 2020's version of the Windows and Xbox maker's aircraft sim that's available to play across Xbox Series X|S and Windows PC platforms like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/steam" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the Xbox app. Notably, it's on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank">Xbox Game Pass</a> and is playable through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> as well, with a PS5 version releasing on December 8.</p><p>The collaboration with Stranger Things is scheduled to release one day later on December 9, with Microsoft and Xbox announcing it on Thursday morning with a short new teaser video you can watch at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1996625547150217319?s=20" target="_blank">Xbox's X channel</a> or via the embed below.</p><p>Notably, it's unclear if this crossover will be a free add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator or a paid expansion; previous collaborations with other franchises have been both, so there's ultimately no way to be sure until Microsoft shares more details.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Turn the skies upside down 🚁Stranger Things x Microsoft Flight Simulator 24 is coming December 9! pic.twitter.com/yXyKTr6z1B<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1996625547150217319">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The type and amount of content added by the crossover also isn't known at present, though the teaser trailer video shows a UH-1H Huey helicopter with a "Hawkins Heli-Tours" logo on it (Hawkins is the name of the fictional town from the show), all-but-confirming that aircraft will be added.</p><p>There <em>is </em>already a Huey in Microsoft Flight Simulator, but it's a third-party one made for the 2020 edition of the game by Taog's Hangar. Assuming this collaboration <em>is </em>adding one, it will obviously be for the newer edition of the flight sim, and potentially by Microsoft's own developers.</p><p>Stranger Things' iconic Hawkins National Laboratory is also visible in the trailer, so you can expect to be able to fly around it — and perhaps even the town of Hawkins as a whole — with the crossover.</p><p>As for other pieces of content that might be coming, we can only speculate, but I can see Yuri Ismaylov's Antonov An-2 plane and Kamov Ka-26 helicopter "Katinka" from Season 4 getting added. I'd also <em>love </em>to see Stranger Things' dark parallel dimension, The Upside Down, included as an environment, too, as flying in it would be quite a unique Microsoft Flight Simulator experience.</p><h2 id="a-bold-bizarre-idea-i-m-in-2">A bold, bizarre idea — I'm in</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:748px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="7aBTUcTMsYcZTfkQ62Ej3F" name="katinka-pic" alt="The Kamov Ka-26 helicopter "Katinka" from Stranger Things Season 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7aBTUcTMsYcZTfkQ62Ej3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="748" height="421" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Yuri Ismaylov's Kamov Ka-26 helicopter "Katinka" from Season 4 of Stranger Things would be an excellent addition to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Netflix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's impossible to say for sure what we're getting our hands on come December 9 until Microsoft shows more of the crossover off, but broadly speaking, I like the idea of a collaboration with Stranger Things. The wild sci-fi/fantasy/horror hybrid show makes for a bold and bizarre pairing with a flight simulator, which is precisely what makes it a fascinating concept.</p><p>From Microsoft's perspective, it's also an incredibly strong series to do a crossover with, as Stranger Things has always been one of Netflix's most popular shows. It's particularly red-hot right now with Season 5 — its final season — beginning to roll out episodically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/02/stranger-things-season-5-netflix-record" target="_blank">breaking viewership records</a> as it does.</p><p>A franchise as big as Stranger Things has the potential to bring an influx of sales and attention to Microsoft Flight Simulator, which is (as a flight simulator) quite a niche title. Thus, Microsoft is no doubt hoping that this crossover takes off.</p><p>The only problem? As we covered in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review" target="_blank">our review</a>, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 isn't exactly the most <em>stable </em>game, even after extensive patching managed to fix the worst of its launch issues.</p><p>That's a big factor limiting its success, but hey, at least the Xbox/PC version (supported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-play-anywhere" target="_blank">Xbox Play Anywhere</a>) of the $69.99 game is just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.loaded.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-standard-edition-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ww" target="_blank">$55.39 at Loaded</a> right now.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8796265c-f84c-4e62-a1e4-ac23b1f3c0e9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Premium Deluxe Edition: $98.19 at Loaded" data-dimension48="Premium Deluxe Edition: $98.19 at Loaded" data-dimension25="$55.39" href="https://www.loaded.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-standard-edition-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ww" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="iHtDe5EYfuaFSr7ywqBeR6" name="microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-product.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHtDe5EYfuaFSr7ywqBeR6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Stranger Things is soon crossing over with the 2024 edition of Microsoft Flight Simulator, and at the very least, it looks to be adding a new themed Huey helicopter as well as the iconic Hawkins National Laboratory from the show.

In the latest Windows preview builds, a new Run box UI has been discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/phantomofearth/status/1996660509027062148">@Phantomofearth on X</a>, which features a modern interface design that matches Microsoft's current Fluent Design language and is more consistent with the rest of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11">Windows 11</a>.</p><p>The Run dialog box has been part of Windows for decades at this point, but it hasn't really been touched since Windows 95. That means it's been 30 years since the Windows Run dialog box received any love from Microsoft, making it well overdue for a refresh. This is an interface that power users will be very familiar with, and likely use every day via the Win+R keyboard shortcut.</p><p>Microsoft describes the new Run dialog box as the "Modern Run" interface, which is optional and can be toggled on or off via Windows Settings. That means if you don't like it, you can switch back to the older Run box interface if that's what you prefer. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-is-finally-fixing-windows-11s-dark-mode-and-its-been-a-long-time-coming">The company did just add dark mode to the classic Run dialog box</a>, too.</p><p>The Modern Run box is a lot larger, which a larger text entry field and a recent commands list that appears above the text box. The new interface also shows app icons when it finds a match, which is a nice touch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:633px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.02%;"><img id="hF9Yx4VqmTaEZQuHYe9THj" name="modern-run-box" alt="Modern Run box on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hF9Yx4VqmTaEZQuHYe9THj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="633" height="266" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Here's the new Run dialog box on Windows 11 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Phantomofearth on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the new Run box is still hidden in the latest preview builds, and hasn't yet been announced by Microsoft. That means it's not actually functional yet, but the company is actively working on it and it's something we'll likely see the company talk more about next year.</p><p>Microsoft rarely touches classic UI elements like this, so it's fascinating to see the company finally addressing some of these legacy interfaces that have been part of the product since the 90s or even earlier.</p><p>Recently, the company announced that it would be bringing dark mode to more classic UI surface such as those that appear in File Explorer. It does seem like Microsoft is once again interested in attending to the little details in Windows 11, something that I find to be a valuable part of making an OS feel cared for.</p><p>With the Run dialog being updated with modern visuals, it gives me hope that we might see other legacy areas of the OS updated with the same treatment. Might we see an updated File Properties window next, or an updated Registry Editor interface? One can certainly dream.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

AMD actually leaked this revelation itself when it posted a Ryzen 7 9850X3D listing on its official driver website, which was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Olrak29_/status/1995002677106020687" target="_blank">X user Olrak29_</a> on November 29, 2025.</p><p>Although the AMD site listing has been taken down — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amd.com/fr/support/downloads/drivers.html/processors/ryzen/ryzen-9000-series/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d.html" target="_blank">URL now simply shows a 404 error</a> — some info was gleaned with the help of another leaker on X, g01d3nm4ng0.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Ryzen coming... 🧐🧐🧐Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 - 200W, 16C32T, 192MB L3 cache, 5.6GHz/4.3GHz.Ryzen 7 9850X3D - 120W, 8C16T, 96MB L3 cache, 5.6GHz/4.7GHz.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1980605233987559514">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It appears that the 9850X3D chip will have the same 8 cores and 16 threads as the 9800X3D, but it will push its boost clock up to 5.6GHz (compared to 5.2GHz in the 9800X3D). It's alleged that it will run at a similar 120W TDP.</p><p>Of course, the second leak also mentions a Ryzen 9 9950X3D2 chip, something that's been rumored for a few months without official confirmation from AMD. The "X3D2" portion of the name suggests that it could have dual X3D tiles, expanding the chip's V-Cache — the part that makes such a huge difference in PC gaming performance — to proportions yet unseen.</p><p>Turning back to the chip that was accidentally mentioned on AMD's website, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D curiously seems to only represent a slightly higher boost clock without other improvements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jpcGvDABMZj38C822ogAX4" name="amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-chip-socket.jpg" alt="AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor in motherboard socket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpcGvDABMZj38C822ogAX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ben Wilson | Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's unclear for exactly who this chip is intended, especially when there's already the Ryzen 9 9900X3D available for those who need more cores and a higher boost clock.</p><p>The Ryzen 7 9800X3D currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKFMSMYK" target="_blank">retails for about $479</a> (less if you can find it on sale), while the 9900X3D usually sits at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-9900X3D-12-Core-Processor/dp/B0DWGWN8GY" target="_blank">about $599 before discounts</a>. There's definitely room to squeeze in another chip between the two, but with the 9800X3D so readily available at an (assumedly) lower price, AMD will have to work some magic positioning its "upgrade" as a meaningful improvement over the flagship chip.</p><p>It could also instead completely replace the 9800X3D over time; I'm hoping to hear more details from AMD at CES 2026.</p><p><em>(via </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-confirms-ryzen-7-9850x3d-an-even-faster-8-core-cpu-with-3d-v-cache" target="_blank"><em>Videocardz</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/amds-dual-v-cache-uber-cpu-gets-a-rumoured-name-and-a-high-clocked-single-die-cousin-give-it-up-for-the-ryzen-9-9950x3d2-and-ryzen-7-9850x3d/" target="_blank"><em>PC Gamer</em></a><em>)</em></p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

You can check out the announcement trailer below:</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPIpN9OKKR4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Nagash is described as being a race unto himself, directly controlling a vast undead army that pulls on the existing Tomb Kings <em>and</em> Vampire Counts rosters. There are also some new powerful units, with the Khemric Titans and Morghasts added into the fray.</p><p>Nagash is the most powerful necromancer in the world, but he still seeks to delegate power for his plan through the Mortarchs, lieutenants that are giving some his power and authority.</p><p>Creative Assembly explains that Nagash will have access to the same potential Mortarchs from the original End Times, including Mannfred von Carstein and Luthor Harkon.</p><p>The End Times also brings changes to the map itself, with the world fracturing and changing through volcanic activity and Warpstone corruption. You can see a flyover of some of the changes that can happen in the video below:</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLjrKH5w9n8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Naturally, there are other Legendary Lords coming alongside Nagash, including one that'll be entirely free.</p><p>This announcement also coincides with Creative Assembly unlocking the Immortal Empires mode, meaning that anyone who owns Total War: Warhammer or Total War: Warhammer 2 can jump in and play the massive combined map without buying the third game.</p><p>We'll have to wait a bit to learn more, but for now, I'm extremely excited.

Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/google_antigravity/comments/1p82or6/google_antigravity_just_deleted_the_contents_of/" target="_blank">Deep-Hyena492 made a post</a> last week laying out in detail the error that occurred as they were attempting to code an app.</p><p>If you're not a developer, chances are high that you've never heard of Google Antigravity. It's an AI-based integrated development environment (IDE) running on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsofts-advantages-in-artificial-intelligence-evaporate-google-gemini-surges-ahead-and-openai-declares-code-red-situation">Google's Gemini AI</a>, and it sets itself apart from other similar platforms by being "agent first."</p><p>In non-AI terms, that means the AI agent inside of Antigravity can work autonomously, and it's powerful enough to handle complex tasks like planning, browsing, and coding with hardly any human intervention.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/google" target="_blank">Google</a> advertises its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://antigravity.google/" target="_blank">Antigravity IDE</a> as "built for user trust, whether you're a professional developer working in a large enterprise codebase, a hobbyist vibe-coding in their spare time, or anyone in between." That trust has seemingly been broken.</p><p>Not only does the Reddit user bring text receipts from the Antigravity mix-up, but they also posted an 11-minute video demonstrating the damage in an attempt to prove that they're not simply a Google competitor stirring up mud.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpBK1vYAVlA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Here's how the error is alleged to have occurred: Deep-Hyena492 was troubleshooting the in-development app, which required a server restart. In order to restart the server, its cache had to be deleted.</p><p>The developer asked Google's Antigravity AI to perform the task, which, of course, it was happy to oblige. But once the AI had executed the command, it quickly became clear to the developer that it had deleted a lot more than the server's cache. The PC's entire D: drive had been wiped.</p><p>The developer immediately asked the AI agent if they'd ever been given permission to delete the entire D: drive. The AI agent responded, "No, you absolutely did not give me permission to do that." As an explanation, the AI agent claims it "incorrectly targeted the root of your D: drive instead of the specific project folder."</p><p>The good news is that the AI agent, upon being grilled about the missing data, was very apologetic. Can you feel the sarcasm coming through your screen? The AI's apology reads, "I am deeply, deeply sorry. This is a critical failure on my part."

Up until now, Windows on ARM hasn't had an avenue for pairing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/arm64-and-ai-and-the-great-reset-in-pcs">ARM64</a> chip with a discrete AMD or NVIDIA GPU. Even Intel and its stellar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/intel-arc">Arc GPUs</a> are out of the question. Why? The big GPU manufacturers simply haven't bothered creating proper drivers for the ARM-based Windows package.</p><p>This incompatibility essentially means that when you buy a Windows PC running Windows on ARM — a market currently completely dominated by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/what-is-snapdragon-x-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X</a> chips — you're stuck with integrated graphics. Lisuan Technology, a company founded in 2021 and headquartered in Shanghai, evidently wants to change that.</p><p>Lisuan debuted its 7G106 card in July 2025 as China's first 6nm GPU designed for gaming. Featuring 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, DirectX 12 support, and a slick blower design, it made some waves in the PC gaming world before the company seemingly put its head down to work on its product.</p><p>We now have an update in the form of a 26-second video posted on the Chinese platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1gGSNBWEF5/" target="_blank">bilibili</a>. The video shows the Lisuan 7G106 GPU running on a system with an ARM-based CPU (a Chinese 12-core CP8180 v9 ARM chip from 2024), being benchmarked using 3DMark's Steel Nomad test in Windows on ARM.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmVZaU34wJpxQhm5u8sKDF" name="LISUAN-GPU-ARM-WINDOWS-2" alt="Lisuan GPU running on Windows on ARM" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmVZaU34wJpxQhm5u8sKDF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: bilibili)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="slide-description">A look at the test system's components through the Windows 11 Task Manager.</p></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h8dXQ7kZKni6DiGrsUywCF" name="LISUAN-GPU-ARM-WINDOWS-1" alt="Lisuan GPU running on Windows on ARM" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8dXQ7kZKni6DiGrsUywCF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: bilibili)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="slide-description">A look at the DirectX display panel on the Windows on ARM test system.</p></div></div></div><p>During the demonstration, a DirectX 12 window is shown in the OS, and we can clearly see in the Windows Task Manager that the hardware all checks out.

At the time, Microsoft described the feature, tagged 488800 in the Microsoft 365 Roadmap, as follows: <em>"When users connect to their organization's Wi-Fi, Teams will automatically set their work location to reflect the building they are working in."</em></p><p>However, the company quietly changed how the feature works, suggesting that it's actually disabled by default, making it more of an opt-in experience. Here's the new description of the feature after Microsoft modified it following user backlash:</p><div><blockquote><p>When users connect to their organization's Wi-Fi, Teams will soon be able to automatically update their work location to reflect the building they're working from. This feature will be off by default. Tenant admins will decide whether to enable it and require end-users to opt-in.</p></blockquote></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-teams-location-wifi/" target="_blank">MakeUseOf reached out</a> to Microsoft for a comment about the controversial feature and the recent changes to its description, but the company didn't provide any insightful information. <em>“Thank you for reaching out.

As a result, there was a surge in demand for collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google's suite of productivity tools to make the transition as smooth as possible.</p><p>Microsoft was uniquely positioned to benefit from this as it had bundled Teams with Office 365, making its offer more attractive compared to its rivals. As you may know, the software giant has been in the spotlight for this very reason. Salesforce's Slack cited anticompetitive business practices, which placed Microsoft under the radar of antitrust watchdogs.</p><p>The company eventually caved to the mounting pressure, forcing it to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-teams/microsoft-dodges-eu-antitrust-fine-unbundles-teams-from-office-365">unbundle Teams from its Office 365</a> suite of productivity tools, which allowed it to dodge a hefty fine from the European Commission. Users will now be forced to purchase a standalone Teams license for approximately $5.50 (€5) per user per month. This is regardless of whether they already have an Office 365 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a> subscription.</p><p>In September, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/microsoft-mandates-return-to-office-claims-teams-and-all-remote-work-solutions-are-inferior">Microsoft announced its return-to-office (RTO) plan</a>, citing that employees tend to work best when collaborating in person. By the end of February 2026, Microsoft employees working within 50 miles of a Microsoft office will be expected to work onsite for at least three days per week.</p><p>It’s clear that many people aren’t thrilled about the controversial feature. However, Microsoft has emphasized that it’s an opt-in experience, disabled by default, which makes the situation feel a bit more reassuring.</p><p>While this might be a long shot, Microsoft might actually use Teams' location tracking feature to track key performance indicators among its employees and perhaps even ensure that they are adhering to the RTO mandate if their homes fall within a 50-mile radius.

The figure is based on the equity structure used to finance the transaction, although the filing does not disclose how that 93.4% was calculated.</p><p>The same filing also indicates the fund needs to provide about $29 billion of its own capital to complete the deal. If the deal closes as outlined, a 93.4% stake would give the Public Investment Fund effective control over EA’s corporate decisions. However, it’s important to remember that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-as-usd55b-saudi-backed-takeover-looms">EA has claimed it will maintain creative control.</a></p><h2 id="will-this-buyout-mean-anything-for-fans-2">Will this buyout mean anything for fans?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="enEKrw8VLNBnyXiehqkudN" name="GettyImages-1973230322" alt="A sign is posted in front of the Electronic Arts (EA) headquarters on January 30, 2024 in Redwood City, California." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/enEKrw8VLNBnyXiehqkudN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">EA Logo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Getty Images | Justin Sullivan)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Well, with a total ownership of 93.4%, the Public Investment Fund will have a massive influence over the future direction of EA. This could shift how EA operates long term, as it would place the company under a single investor’s wider strategy rather than the usual quarterly market pressure that comes with being publicly traded.</p><p>It also gives the Public Investment Fund potential influence over where EA chooses to invest next. With effective control, it could encourage expansion into regions or markets that align with its broader investment goals. The Public Investment Fund has already made several high-profile moves across entertainment and sports, and gaming has become a major focus of its wider strategy.</p><p>In gaming specifically, they hold smaller minority stakes in companies such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/saudi-arabia-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-nintendo?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Nintendo</a>, Capcom, Nexon, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/saudia-arabias-wealth-fund-takes-8-stake-gaming-firm-embracer-2022-06-08/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Embracer Group</a>, but these positions do not give them control.</p><p>As for what it will mean for us, gamers and fans of EA’s work, we won’t truly know. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/its-official-battlefield-6-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-and-holy-smokes-it-had-the-biggest-launch-month-of-any-game-in-the-past-3-years-too">EA just had a very strong launch with Battlefield 6</a>, and it is still releasing its annual sports games, which I doubt will change.

Outlook has a poor reputation for its spam filtering, but today's incident was particularly bad. It also made me wonder why Microsoft isn't using the resources at its disposal to fix Outlook's spam filter.</p><p>If Microsoft insists on forcing AI into everything from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-just-revealed-how-windows-11-is-evolving-into-an-agentic-os-finally-the-explanation-weve-all-been-waiting-for">Windows 11</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/microsoft-adds-tables-and-more-ai-to-notepad-what-happened-to-the-app-we-loved">Notepad</a>, the tech giant should help everyday consumers with daily annoyances. Spam emails, at minimum, bog down productivity. In worst-case scenarios, they can be used to scam unsuspecting people and hurt organizations.</p><p>I'm not alone in my complaint. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1gxfni7/why_cant_microsoft_and_all_of_their_ai_stop_spam/">Reddit</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/answers/questions/5522556/why-havent-you-implemented-an-ai-spam-filter">Microsoft's website</a> have several posts complaining about Outlook's spam filter that also suggest using AI to fix the problem.</p><p>To be honest, Microsoft may already have some form of AI working to flag spam emails, but the company clearly isn't using its best AI tools to address the problem.</p><h2 id="ai-email-protection-2">AI email protection</h2><p>When looking through my inbox and junk folder in Outlook, I noticed the Copilot logo already appears on the screen. Copilot in Outlook can summarize emails, draft responses, summarize meetings, and help in a variety of other ways. At the moment, Copilot does not seem to be involved in spam filtering — but I got curious.</p><p>To see if Copilot can already detect spam, I sent some screenshots of my inbox and junk folders to the AI tool. To my surprise, not only did Copilot correctly identify spam emails, it discovered legitimate emails that had been flagged as junk.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.89%;"><img id="RL4BHzQqy3WoeAwyif88WV" name="Spam-email-outlook" alt="Spam email in Outlook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RL4BHzQqy3WoeAwyif88WV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1184" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An obvious spam email passed Outlook's filters and arrived in my inbox this morning. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Copilot noted that it could not analyze the content of my inbox, which makes sense since I had just shared screenshots. To test Copilot more, I screenshotted the contents of a specific email that is obviously spam (but that had made it through Outlook's spam filter).</p><p>"That email is <strong>almost certainly junk</strong>, and likely part of a phishing or scam campaign," said Copilot. The tool then went on to explain why the email was junk.</p><ul><li><strong>Sender address:</strong> customerservice@mh.familyaginglifecare.com<ul><li>This domain has <strong>no connection</strong> to MailOnline, Dragons’ Den, or any reputable weight loss brand. It’s a random, misleading domain trying to look official.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Subject line:</strong> ...The_Dragons’_Den_D.e.a.l._That_Changed_Everything#4650<ul><li>The use of underscores, ellipses, and hashtags is classic spam formatting — designed to bypass filters.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Recipient address:</strong> admin@zglz.kI9cA5k2.o5P<ul><li>That’s not a normal email address format. It looks auto-generated or spoofed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Attachments:</strong><ul><li>A calendar invite (invite.ics) and a “not supported calendar message” — both are suspicious. Spammers often use .ics files to sneak in malicious links or auto-schedule scam calls.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Body content:</strong><ul><li>Claims that <em>all five Dragons offered £1 million</em> for a supplement called “Lean X” — this is a <strong>fabricated story</strong>. There’s no record of such a deal on Dragons’ Den, and these kinds of fake endorsements are common in weight loss scams.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Brand misuse:</strong><ul><li>The email uses the <strong>MailOnline logo</strong> and references a popular TV show to build false credibility. That’s a known tactic in spam campaigns.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I'd be willing to bet many of you saw the subject line and screenshot of that email and immediately recognized it as junk. Copilot determined the same thing. And yet, Outlook placed that email lovingly inside my inbox alongside emails from my friends, family, and colleagues.</p><p>On the flip side, Copilot can also identify legitimate emails that have been wrongly flagged as spam. The tool looked at a screenshot of my junk folder that I provided and correctly determined two of the emails shown were legitimate.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised to see Copilot even referenced the fact that I am a football coach to strengthen the case that an email from Craig Roh is not junk. Roh sends out coaching tips and I have signed up for his newsletter. Copilot noted that the email was likely flagged due to its bulk formatting.</p><p>That's the type of behavior I would expect from an integrated tool within Outlook. Microsoft knows a lot about me already since I use Copilot often. Spam filtering should improve over time as I use Microsoft's AI suite and stay up-to-date with likely scams and nuisances because Copilot is plugged into the web.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

But equally, since it was advertised ahead of Black Ops 7 this was going to be a thing, I can't help but feel it should have been ready by now?</p><p>In any case, the overall result should be positive. Right from the Black Ops 7 beta, the number of cheaters getting through was minimal. It's a constant cat and mouse game, but the early days of Black Ops 7 have been pretty good.</p><p>Of course, Warzone as a free-to-play title, is always going to be a significant target for these people who seem to think that cheating to fake being good at a video game somehow gives their lives meaning.

It made looking for actual content feel messy on mobile. The Xbox app has always been useful for queuing downloads to your console, but it never offered a real storefront of its own.</p><p>If you wanted to buy something, the app often pushed you to a web page instead.

This update moves the app closer to that direction.</p><p>However, users should not expect mobile games that install directly through the Xbox app. This update focuses purely on console and PC content rather than standalone mobile titles.</p><p>Perhaps just as important, the Xbox app now feels much better and noticeably faster, and might actually be good now? If you have access to the update, let us know what you think and whether it feels like a real improvement or more of the same. In our testing, it does seem far smoother than before.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b797b5ef-5489-4875-ba00-e5ac6eec378b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Xbox Game Pass Ultimate got a big price hike a few months back, costing $30 a month.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Whether it's Xbox stock supply issues or tariffs triggering price hikes, Xbox Series X|S hardware can't catch a break.</p><p>When the United States President Trump kicked off a trade war with China, it caused massive price increases across a variety of products. One business particularly hard hit has been video game consoles — which do not enjoy the same exemptions as other electronics. The United States exempted Apple's iPhones from tariffs for example to protect one of its top national tech businesses. But, it did not extend the same courtesy to the only U.S.-based console player still going: good old Xbox.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/xbox-series-s-faq">Xbox Series S</a> launch, Microsoft was strong out of the gate, even beating the PlayStation 5 in U.S. dollar sales (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23040875/xbox-series-x-s-sales-nintendo-switch-ps5-npd-march-2022">The Verge and Circana</a>) for a few months. But then, PS5 supplies began surging ahead. Xbox hasn't been able to keep up ever since,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-fy26-q1-earnings"> with hardware declines posted nearly every quarter</a> for the past couple of years. To make matters worse, it was forced to raise prices a few months ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/tariffs-bite-xbox-fans-even-harder-as-microsoft-once-again-increases-xbox-series-x-s-prices">making the Xbox Series X, and in some cases, the less powerful Xbox Series S more expensive</a> than some PS5 models. Tariffs have played a huge part in making Xbox Series X|S less competitive.</p><p>To avoid these types of price increases, manufacturers like Sony PlayStation and Nintendo have moved some of their hardware production out of China, which has been disproportionately targeted in Trump's tariff blitz. One country that has benefitted from this is Vietnam, which has increasingly started to assert its position in all types of electronics manufacturing. The country can now count Xbox among those.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qCeKwCST3nUzvNWgXE7PT5" name="xbox-series-x-cpu.jpg" alt="Xbox Series X Motherboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qCeKwCST3nUzvNWgXE7PT5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Xbox Series X is arguably the best video game console Microsoft has ever made, but it has struggled to sell as quickly as some of its predecessors.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a new report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/foxconn-subsidiary-plans-expand-production-vietnam-document-shows-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>, electronics manufacturing heavyweights Foxconn and Luxshare have submitted planning proposals to local authorities, aimed specifically at growing their video game console footprint.</p><p>Fushan Technology, part of Foxconn, is seeking production permits specifically for Microsoft Xbox gaming devices, the report claims. Fushan aims to scale up to 4.8 million additional Xbox gaming devices as part of the permit, which likely includes Xbox Series X|S consoles, official Xbox controllers, accessories like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/accessories/headphones-headsets/xbox-wireless-headset-review">official Xbox headset</a>, and possibly even Xbox Cloud Gaming server tech. Do note that this wouldn't include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-ally">Xbox Ally</a> handheld — which is produced by ASUS, not Microsoft, despite the branding. China's Luxshare-ICT has also posted proposals to expand its own console manufacturing operation by an additional 4.5 million units per year.</p><p>Microsoft has been dividing its Xbox Series X silicon between retail Xbox Series X consoles and Xbox Cloud Gaming servers as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-cloud-gaming-comes-millions-of-players-in-brazil">expands capacity in countries like Brazil and India</a>, which also suffer disproportionately from tariffs and taxes inflating Xbox local hardware prices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-hours-up-45-percent-with-game-pass-but-lets-read-between-the-lines-a-bit">Microsoft recently said its Xbox Cloud Gaming use had seen a 45% growth rate year-over-year</a>, even as Xbox Series X|S supplies decline.</p><h2 id="xbox-is-still-in-the-game-2">Xbox is still in the game</h2><div class="jwplayer__widthsetter">    <div class="jwplayer__wrapper">        <div id="futr_botr_dhQydjpn_tZxG0uaR_div"            class="future__jwplayer"            data-player-id="tZxG0uaR"            data-playlist-id="dhQydjpn">            <div id="botr_dhQydjpn_tZxG0uaR_div"></div>        </div>    </div></div><p>One thing I am constantly asked about on social media is whether or not Xbox is "exiting" console hardware. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Microsoft has reiterated plans to build a next-gen Xbox console, which is set to be more PC-like than ever</a> with the capability to run Steam and other Windows PC apps and gaming platforms. Another reason people often think Xbox is leaving hardware is Xbox Series X|S stock supplies, which are often difficult to find stocked up in some regions.</p><p>Indeed, Microsoft didn't do <em>any </em>Xbox Series X|S deals for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, owing to the stock shortage. Diversifying its supply chain will hopefully help boost Xbox Series X|S production in what could be a pretty huge year for the platform.

Now, though, it's being shuttered as Micron shifts its manufacturing efforts to focus solely on supporting AI companies.</p><p>The firm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" target="_blank">announced</a> the news on Wednesday morning, explaining that the decision "reflects Micron’s commitment to its ongoing portfolio transformation and the resulting alignment of its business to secular, profitable growth vectors in memory and storage."</p><p>Its ultimate goal is to strengthen its business performance in the long-term and "and create value for strategic customers as well as stakeholders" — AKA, big corporations attempting to experiment with and develop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">artifical intelligence</a> products, <em>not </em>people like you and I.</p><p>"The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments," said Micron executive vice president and chief business officer Sumit Sadana in a statement.</p><p>“Thanks to a passionate community of consumers, the Crucial brand has become synonymous with technical leadership, quality and reliability of leading-edge memory and storage products. We would like to thank our millions of customers, hundreds of partners and all of the Micron team members who have supported the Crucial journey for the last 29 years," he added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="jZFNMZKEpAxChizjC9Wf9a" name="crucial-t500-1tb-ssd-heatsink-on-keyboard" alt="Crucial T500 1TB SSD with heatsink on a mechanical gaming keyboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZFNMZKEpAxChizjC9Wf9a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1284" height="721" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Crucial's RAM and SSDs is popular in the PC building market, but in just three months, you won't be able to buy it anymore. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Crucial)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Micron says it's committed to continuing the sale of Crucial products until the end of its current second fiscal quarter, which is February 2026. Once March begins, however, you'll no longer be able to purchase Crucial RAM and SSD from PC part retailers.</p><p>The firm has also stated it "will work closely with partners and customers through this transition," and that it will continue to provide support for Crucial products and fulfill any warranty obligations. Additionally, it intends to keep selling "Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial channel customers globally."</p><p>As for those working for the Crucial brand that will soon find themselves out of work, Micron has noted it intends to offer its employees "redeployment opportunities" for open positions elsewhere in the firm.</p><p>All in all, it's good that the company seems to be — or at least <em>plans </em>to be — handling the closure of Crucial ethically, but this is still a tragedy for consumers and hobbyists looking to build or purchase a PC. Not only are we losing a reputable and well-respected RAM and storage brand, but we're also likely going to see prices climb, too.</p><p>Indeed, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/epic-games-ceo-ram-price-increases-will-be-a-real-problem-for-high-end-gaming" target="_blank">the price of RAM has already skyrocketed</a> due to a surge of demand from AI companies, resulting in kits themselves as well as devices with RAM in them becoming more and more difficult to afford.

The shortage of RAM on the market is already frustrating, and I'm not looking forward to it getting worse.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When is Crucial shutting down?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Micron's Crucial consumer RAM kits and storage devices and components like SSDs will continue to be sold until the end of February 2026.

Max this out for a big "Capstone" upgrade to one affix.</li><li>Monsters are smarter now - Better AI, new affixes, tighter elite packs and more danger in general everywhere.</li><li>Defense is different - New Toughness stat has been added, and Armor/Resists become ratings, potions heal you instantly and Fortify is now extra life that self-heals you.</li><li>Renown is gone - Has been replaced by Season Rank with each tier gated by a Capstone Dungeon (yes they are back). Rewards come through this track.</li><li>Lesser Evils will invade everything:<br>- Azmodan is a new World Boss and also summonable.<br>- Duriel is found in the Helltide and replaces the Blood Maiden.<br>- Belial will be in The Pit.<br>- Andariel owns the Undercity and can spawn as final boss.</li><li>Divine Gifts system adds seasonal power with both Corrupted vs Purified slots for bonuses.</li><li>The final upgrade to chase is Sanctification.

The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realize there’s a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren’t expecting it at first.”</em></p><div

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=windowscentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Windows Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/how-to-choose-websites-that-show-up-in-google-search-on-chrome-edge-or-firefox"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>One of the more bizarre stories in gaming news right now is that of HORSES, a new indie horror game from developer Santa Ragione about working at an unsettling horse farm with some dark secrets over the summer (you may know of the studio from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/mediterranea-inferno-xbox-impressions" target="_blank">2023's well-received visual novel Mediterranea Inferno</a>, among other titles).</p><p>In the days leading up to its release on Tuesday this week, HORSES began making headlines when the news that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/steam" target="_blank">Steam</a> — Valve's PC gaming platform, and the biggest PC gaming storefront in the world by a large margin — banned it in 2023 began to circulate across the web. The developers claim Steam never provided them with detailed reasoning for the ban, and has refused to elaborate or reconsider its decision.</p><p>Then, in the eleventh hour, the Epic Games Store reached out to Santa Ragione to confirm it, too, was delisting HORSES, with the distributor citing an Adult-Only rating (Epic doesn't sell AO games) determined after filling out an International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) Questionnaire. However, the studio says that five weeks ahead of launch, the IARC process was already completed, and it resulted in a PEGI 18 and ESRB M rating.</p><p>But things only continued to get worse for the devs, with the game retailer Humble <em>also </em>axing its distribution of the title, too. Santa Ragione noted in an email sent to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/controversial-horror-game-horses-gets-kicked-off-the-humble-store-one-day-after-launch-but-its-also-become-the-best-selling-new-release-on-gog/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> that the takedown came without an explanation from the storefront, and after Humble reportedly told the studio it would keep it available following Epic's ban.</p><p>The sole bright spot in all of this for the developer is the impact of the Streisand effect, with news of these bans driving gamers to buy and support HORSES on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, where it remains for sale. On both platforms, it's currently the best-selling game.</p><p>That success may ultimately be the only thing that keeps the studio afloat. As noted in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/" target="_blank">new FAQ blog</a>, Steam's ban drove external publishers away from working with Santa Ragione, forcing it to pursue unsustainable private funding to finish the game. The developer claims Steam also refused to give it keys for its previous title Saturnalia to include in bundles that would have helped with the financial troubles.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYewjNYxV-8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>So, what's actually going on here? Why was HORSES banned from Steam, Epic, and Humble? After combing through all the information available to the public, two snippets from Steam's review sent to the developers stand out: "Regardless of a developer’s intentions with their product, we will not distribute content that appears, in our judgment, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor," and "This app has been banned and cannot be reused. Re-submissions of this app, even with modifications, will not be accepted."</p><p>Santa Ragione argues that no part of HORSES violates this policy, though it used to have a scene with a clothed child riding on the shoulders of one of the "horses" — in-game, the "horses" on its farm locale are naked, enslaved humans wearing horse masks — that was quickly changed to feature an adult instead.</p><p>The studio maintains that "The scene is not sexual in any way," and explains that while HORSES "does contain some sexual elements, the intent is never to arouse," and that "It is about tension, not erotic content."</p><p>But due to the second part of Valve's statement in which it makes its intent to rebuff any revisions or appeals clear, its judgement is ultimately final, and the game will never come to Steam unless it changes its mind.</p><p>As for the reason behind Epic's takedown, its own statement to the devs notes "explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior," along with the promotion of "abuse and animal abuse." Santa Ragione says neither are present, with nudity "completely censored via pixelation" and a story that serves as "a strong critique of violence and abuse in general." Humble's reasoning for its ban is unknown.</p><h2 id="steam-and-epic-s-decision-bodes-ill-for-creativity-2">Steam and Epic's decision bodes ill for creativity</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1887px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="STYgBeegvLgekN2BDR5hZU" name="horses-stables-screenshot" alt="Official in-game screenshot of HORSES." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STYgBeegvLgekN2BDR5hZU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1887" height="1062" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Would you want to make anything experimental with mature themes after seeing how Steam and Epic treated HORSES? I wouldn't. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Santa Ragione)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I can understand Steam's initial choice to ban HORSES for its original scene with the young girl (this is by far the most likely explanation), the fact that it refused to consider revisions or appeals from the developers is frankly ridiculous, and Epic's own last-minute delisting is just as absurd.</p><p>It's ham-fisted rigidity from two of the biggest PC gaming platforms in the world, and a signal to studios that getting experimental with the themes and concepts of their projects is a massive risk. And because of the near-monopoly that Steam has over the market, it's one many indie devs can't afford to contend with. Santa Ragione's financial troubles are a clear example of that.</p><p>It's a sad reminder that games, as an artform, are still held to confusing, unreasonable standards compared to film and TV —<strong> </strong>and it's exactly what we <em>don't </em>need right now, with fears of censorship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-takes-down-tons-of-porn-games-cracks-down-on-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content" target="_blank">already being stoked by payment processors</a> requesting that games with certain types of content be taken down, lest they stop working with Steam and other vendors.</p><p>I sincerely hope Steam, Epic, and Humble all reconsider, though I'm not exactly holding my breath. Regardless, HORSES is available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" target="_blank">$4.99 at GOG</a> now, with the game also selling on itch.io.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="da56ae7c-7e4e-48e9-8433-13546ce6b7d8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="HORSES | $4.99 at GOG" data-dimension48="HORSES | $4.99 at GOG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zAgVwQu6LKNCuqNdxCMGvA" name="horses-box-art" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zAgVwQu6LKNCuqNdxCMGvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>HORSES | </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" target="_blank" data-dimension112="da56ae7c-7e4e-48e9-8433-13546ce6b7d8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="HORSES | $4.99 at GOG" data-dimension48="HORSES | $4.99 at GOG" data-dimension25=""><strong>$4.99 at GOG</strong></a><br><br>This short new indie horror game puts you in the shoes of a college student heading to a ranch to do some work over the summer, though you'll soon find that what's going on there is far darker than what you'd expect.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Microsoft is investing a ton in Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox PC right now, and we might've just gotten a small glimpse at the future.</p><p>Microsoft is repositioning Xbox as an "everywhere" platform, where players can expect to purchase content and then run it effectively across any device. It's essentially a strategy inspired by the likes of Minecraft, which has found its way to global domination by being literally everywhere — with content you can bring with you. An entire generation expects gaming to work this way now, and Microsoft is aiming to accommodate with devices like the Xbox Ally and the more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">Steam-like next-gen Xbox console</a>.</p><p>However, in this very heavily digital-first future, purchase and ownership confidence needs to be at the absolute forefront. And there's a snag there potentially.</p><p>Redphx, developer of the excellent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://better-xcloud.github.io/">Better xCloud app</a>, has been following Microsoft's moves on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-cloud-gaming">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> platform quite closely. He tracks games that are hitting the service, either via Xbox Game Pass or Xbox "Stream Your Own Game," but also for the first time recently, games that are actually being removed from the service.</p><p>Microsoft seems to have lost the distribution rights for Dragon Quest Builders 2, Infinity Strash: Dragon Quest The Adventure of Dai, and Mechstermination Force.</p><p>Up until now, the only other game Redphx was able to track as being removed was ElecHead, which was later reinstated.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removed:- DRAGON QUEST BUILDERS 2- Infinity Strash: DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai- Mechstermination Force<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1994959102666252317">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It's unclear why games might be getting removed from Xbox Cloud Gaming this way. It could be that Microsoft added them by mistake in the first place, having not properly acquired the rights to distribute them this way. First I thought it could be due to particularly low usage, but that doesn't make a whole lot of sense given how many other games are being added there.</p><p>Either way, it's problematic if a user has specifically purchased a game <em>for </em>cloud gaming, only to find it later removed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-cloud-gaming-could-be-gearing-up-for-an-official-launch-in-india">Regions like Brazil and India are becoming major cloud-first markets for Microsoft,</a> so guarantees games you purchase will actually remain available seems to be incredibly important. If you did purchase these games digitally, they would still be available to play on an Xbox Series X|S console, but that doesn't help if you don't actually <em>own </em>one — and Microsoft keeps telling us everything is an Xbox these days.</p><p>We'll ask Microsoft to comment on the situation, but they're currently operating on reduced staffing for the holiday period.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Sources familiar with the situation tell me that this is an exception, rather than the rule. I'll see if we can get something concrete from Microsoft itself.</p><p>Microsoft now has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-more-games-stream-your-own-game-cloud-save-status">over 2,000 games in Xbox Cloud Gaming as titles you can buy digitally specifically for cloud</a>. The vast majority of them are indie-styled games, but there are a variety of very big names available on the service too, including The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-latest-xbox-cloud-gaming-upgrades-are-a-revelation">Microsoft is also rolling out upgrades to 1440p streaming for specific titles on Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, for users with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><h2 id="but-wait-there-s-more-2">But wait, there's more! </h2><p>Redphx also uncovered another interesting morsel of news from Xbox Cloud Gaming recently, though, which might hint at a broader redesign for the interface.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/redphx/status/1996047004494168534?s=20">Redphx found a promotional video</a> and a URL that activates a new interface for Xbox Cloud Gaming, and there's also a promo video that contained a brief flash of what the layout might look like. Part of me has been wondering if this interface might not simply be for cloud, but Xbox PC in general.</p><p>Right now, the Xbox PC app interface is eventually going to be the interface for the next-gen Xbox console, using the Windows 11 Full Screen App experience seen on the Xbox Ally and other devices. The Xbox PC app right now is simply a big advertisement for Xbox Game Pass, but that would have to change a fair bit if it eventually comes to encompass everything your console is and does.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.94%;"><img id="FES9nSd2EUNxdpMyeGZYbV" name="New Xbox Cloud Gaming Interface" alt="New Xbox Cloud gaming interface in testing?" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FES9nSd2EUNxdpMyeGZYbV.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1074" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Some of these details look like they'd be more at home on the Xbox PC app than simply Xbox Cloud Gaming.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft via <a href="http://x.com/@RedPhx">@RedPhx</a>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the screengrab from the promo image above, you can see the layout actually looks a bit more similar to the Xbox PC app, rather than Xbox Cloud Gaming. There's also the back button, as well as the large feature content panels on the right — other aspects present on Xbox PC, but not Xbox Cloud Gaming. Instead of Xbox PC app icons on the left, we now have two new panels. One for friends by the looks of it, as well as another for your play history.</p><p>Microsoft added play history to Xbox PC and Xbox console over the summer. It brings in all of your recent games regardless of platform, as long as they're compatible. It's a useful tool for those who jump from platform to platform (as I do), making it quick and painless to access recently played games without having to jump through hoops.</p><iframe title="How can Microsoft improve Xbox PC?" description="What are some of the ways you'd like to see Xbox improve the PC app for Xbox?" minimumCommentCount="0" data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src=""></iframe><p>A significant investment Microsoft is pushing forward for Xbox revolves around the idea of "play anywhere," whether it's cloud, PC, TVs, phones, or Xbox consoles. Unifying the interfaces between Xbox cloud, PC, and consoles is doubtlessly on the agenda, making me wonder if the above screencap isn't just intended for Xbox Cloud Gaming, but perhaps all of Xbox all up. If I had to guess, it was probably the latter.</p><p>Typically I'd just assume it was concept art, but considering it was found alongside the ability to "upgrade" to the new interface ... I'm guessing it's more than that. I'll keep digging for some hard confirmation, so hang tight.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Sources familiar tell me that this indeed representative of efforts to converge Xbox Cloud Gaming's interface and the Xbox PC app interface to match each other. There's a chance elements of this might extend to Xbox Series X|S as well. The digging continues. 🤔</p><p>I recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/indies-idxbox/the-falconeer-dev-talks-id-xbox">spoke to Falconeer developer Tomas Sala</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/new-blood-interactive-on-their-big-xbox-launch">New Blood Interactive's Dave Oshry</a> on how Microsoft can improve the Xbox experience for devs and players alike. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/id-xbox-chief-chris-charla-talks-to-us-about-microsofts-indie-game-dev-program-we-dont-want-bringing-games-to-xbox-to-be-a-lengthy-painful-process">ID@Xbox chief Chris Charla said the firm is taking feedback to heart</a> as it moves towards a more Steam-like platform for the next Xbox.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-ally">Xbox Ally</a> PC gaming handheld is the testbed for all of this stuff, and if the above interface is indeed a hint at the future of Xbox PC, we should see it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-ally-2026-update-roadmap-improvements-next-gen">Xbox Ally in early 2026 alongside the promised docking update</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e5730785-50a1-48e2-a851-cf142bc81914" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Xbox Game Pass Ultimate saw a significant price increase a few months back, but Amazon is discounting one‑month time cards by a full third off the regular cost.

The company says this issue mostly impacts enterprise PCs, and is "unlikely" to occur on personal devices.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5072911-explorer-the-start-menu-and-other-xaml-dependent-apps-might-not-start-or-close-unexpectedly-on-some-enterprise-devices-d2d30684-4e2b-47f5-9899-a00a8e0acb09#cw">support document</a> published by Microsoft says that <em>"After provisioning a PC with a Windows 11, version 24H2 or a Windows 11, version 25H2 monthly cumulative update released on or after July 2025, XAML-dependent modern apps such as Explorer, the Start menu, SystemSettings, Taskbar and Windows Search might experience difficulties."</em></p><p>This issue impacts all integral and OS level interfaces, from the Windows Explorer to the Taskbar and Start menu. If the problem arises on your PC, you can expect to experience issues such as the Start menu failing to open when clicking Start, the Taskbar disappearing, Windows Settings failing to open, and logging into a blank screen with no desktop interface.</p><p>The good news is Microsoft has already identified a cause for the problem, stating that it's because the OS is failing to register certain XAML packages in time after installing new Windows updates. The company is working on a resolution, but no update is available yet that addresses the issue.</p><p>There are workarounds available however, which we've detailed below:</p><ul><li>IT administrators managing enterprise or virtualized environments should register the missing packages in the user session and restart <strong>SiHost</strong> to allow Immersive Shell and related components to pick them up. To do this, run the following commands to register each of the missing packages:<ul><li>Add-AppxPackage -Register -Path 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy\appxmanifest.xml' -DisableDevelopmentMode </li><li>Add-AppxPackage -Register -Path 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.UI.Xaml.CBS_8wekyb3d8bbwe\appxmanifest.xml' -DisableDevelopmentMode </li><li>Add-AppxPackage -Register -Path 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core_cw5n1h2txyewy\appxmanifest.xml' -DisableDevelopmentMode </li></ul></li></ul><p>For non-persistent environments, a logon script approach remains the best option for IT administrators. Create a batch file wrapper to execute synchronously before Explorer launches using PowerShell:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-powershell" language="powershell" ><code>@echo off REM Register MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Add-AppxPackage -Register -Path 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy\appxmanifest.xml' -DisableDevelopmentMode" REM Register Microsoft.UI.Xaml.CBS powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Add-AppxPackage -Register -Path 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.UI.Xaml.CBS_8wekyb3d8bbwe\appxmanifest.xml' -DisableDevelopmentMode" REM Register MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Add-AppxPackage -Register -Path 'C:\Windows\SystemApps\MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core_cw5n1h2txyewy\appxmanifest.xml' -DisableDevelopmentMode" </code></pre><p>The silver lining here is that this issue is unlikely to impact you if you are using Windows 11 on a personal PC. It appears these problems are mostly appearing on devices that are issued by your work, and that's only bad news if you need to get work done before an imminent deadline.</p><p>That said, it's just another example of how sloppy Microsoft has become when it comes to quality and stability on Windows 11. It's not great that an issue this significant has been able to slip through into the OS since July, capable of taking down basically every UI surface the user might need to interact with to get work done on their PC.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Considering how many people use Steam — 132 million monthly active users as of November 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.demandsage.com/steam-statistics/">DemandSage</a> — an increase of 5 percentage points for Windows 11 represents a large number of users.</p><p>Those rooting for Windows as a platform don't have anything to worry about when it comes to Steam software usage. 94.79% of all Steam users are on some form of Windows, with Windows 10 sitting at second place with a 29.06% market share. Windows 7 still has a surprisingly measurable 0.08% share.</p><p>If you group iterations of the same OS together, Linux  (3.20%) trails Windows.

During the podcast, the duo touched on numerous topics, including what Sala would like to see improve across the Xbox PC store.</p><p><em>"I'd like the store to be more user-friendly and look cooler. It doesn't look very cool to me," </em>Sala explains, adding that having a store page easily allow players to follow a developer on Bluesky would be extremely helpful.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xTH8EUeHU2SndCrUerZ5J4" name="the-falconeer-1.jpg" alt="The Falconeer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTH8EUeHU2SndCrUerZ5J4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Falconeer has enjoyed a ton of updates since its launch, and is a vastly improved game from year's past.

Sala suggested that Microsoft could do more to showcase what games actually look like right away, before expecting users to click in. <br><br>Sala also described how Xbox could boost its community-building tools, and noted that even Valve could do more here with Steam. <em>"I'll post my development updates and people love following how something gets created, and in the beginning it all looks like shit, and then a year later it looks pretty cool... that's a wonderful journey to enjoy,"</em> he says. <em>"I would love to see that, that people can follow me as a creator and realize that they're not buying into a single game... they're buying into a person, or a world, or a universe." </em></p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TT-7kGk9ANs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Continuing the discussion with things he'd like to see improve on the Xbox Store, Sala touches on the challenges of game discovery, and how it would be nice to have the Xbox PC app give recommendations and updates on what someone should play.<br><br>Touching on the challenge of getting attention in a time of TikTok videos and Instagram Shorts sucking up screen time, Sala points how Microsoft can and should be leveraging the advantages of a subscription service with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>. <br><br><em>"The great thing about Game Pass is people are very experimental with the games they try, and they try a lot more variety... they're a bit harsher, they'll find stuff 'Oh, I don't like that' and they'll let you know, but they'll have tried it," </em>Sala says.</p><p>The Falconeer and Bulwark are both available on Xbox Play Anywhere for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox PC, as well as Steam.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="77bea433-5caf-4946-a90f-b9e390ee2bb5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Falconeer is an aerial combat game similar to the likes of Star Fox and Crimson Skies.

But Google isn't the only top AI research lab making significant leaps in the ever-evolving sector amid claims that we're in an bubble, which could burst anytime.</p><p>Apple might be consider a late-bloomer in the AI landscape compared to its rivals like OpenAI, which Microsoft CEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/microsoft-ceo-claims-openai-had-two-years-of-runway-in-the-ai-race">Satya Nadella claims had a 2-year runway to build ChatGPT uncontested</a>. Until now, the iPhone maker has only shared shiny demos, highlighting what users should expect from its Apple Intelligence strategy. However, it has only delivered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/apple-intelligence-could-be-vaporware">trivial AI features like Writing Tools</a>.</p><p>However, the company is making strategic moves to ensure that it is equipped with the best AI talent to bolster its AI advances and development. More recently, Apple hired Amar Subramanya, who served as the Corporate Vice President at Microsoft AI.</p><p>Perhaps more interestingly, Subramanya was only at Microsoft four months after departing from Google, where he worked as the Vice President of Engineering for over 16 years.</p><p>Subramanya is now Apple's Vice President of AI. Coincidentally, his appointment comes after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/john-giannandrea-to-retire-from-apple/">Apple announced that John Giannandrea retirement </a>as senior vice president for machine learning and AI at Apple.</p><p>He'll report to Craig Federighi and will help spearhead critical operations within Apple, including Apple Foundation Models, ML research, AI Safety and Evaluation.</p><p>According to Apple:</p><p><em>"Subramanya brings a wealth of experience to Apple, having most recently served as corporate vice president of AI at Microsoft, and previously spending 16 years at Google, where he was head of engineering for Google’s Gemini Assistant prior to his departure. His deep expertise in both AI and ML research and in integrating that research into products and features will be important to Apple’s ongoing innovation and future Apple Intelligence features."</em></p><p>The change in Apple's AI leadership doesn't entirely comes as a surprise. The iPhone maker has faced major challenges and setbacks in the AI space, making it difficult to compete against rivals like Microsoft and OpenAI.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role">Bloomberg report </a>from earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook admitted that he had <em>"lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development,"</em> prompting him to discharge Siri's revamp to other executives.</p><p>Apple reshuffling leadership in it AI division is expected to expedite advances in the landscape, possibly allowing it to catch-up with its competitors. The company's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, and Global VP of Marketing, Greg Joswiak revealed that they were developing to versions of the revamped Siri simultaneously, but both fell below expectations, making it difficult to deliver Apple Intelligence within the communicated timeline.</p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

And while the former holds a competitive advantage over the latter due to its massive market share and broad app compatibility, Linux is starting to gain some traction, especially after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-10/windows-10-eol-esu-faq">Microsoft ended Windows 10 support on October 14, 2025</a>.</p><p>For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-10/windows-10-retirement-pushes-780-000-users-to-linux-as-zorin-os-hits-1m-downloads">Zorin OS, a Linux distro, gained approximately 780,000 users from Windows</a>, a little over a month after Microsoft pulled the plug on Windows 10.

And now, one of the biggest, most-popular modpacks of all time has joined the program.</p><p>That modpack is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_gamma" target="_blank">STALKER GAMMA</a> (Grok's Automated Modular Modpack for Anomaly), a huge collection of add-ons for STALKER Anomaly (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_anomaly" target="_blank">also on GOG</a>), which is itself a free, standalone<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/stalker" target="_blank"> STALKER</a> FPS game built using the open source 64-bit version of the X-Ray engine the original trilogy of STALKER games use.</p><p>Anomaly is essentially a free roam, exploration-focused version of all three of the late-2000s STALKER titles combined into one, and GAMMA builds on top of it with over 400 curated mods from the Anomaly modding community that transform it into a hardcore survival experience.</p><p>Grok, the modpack's author, has gone to painstaking lengths to adjust and tweak each add-on in the suite to finely tune the gameplay difficulty, and also to ensure that everything works and plays nicely together without any compatibility-related issues.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANNGWOhhJ4k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The key defining feature of GAMMA is the fact that trader NPCs throughout STALKER's fictional, supernatural version of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone — simply "The Zone" — don't sell weapons or armor, instead dealing only in ammo, food, and <em>parts </em>for said pieces of gear, among other supplies.</p><p>That means the only way to get stronger is by finding loot in stashes you come across or on the bodies of hostile stalkers you kill, or by completing quests. And since that loot will almost always be damaged, you'll need to spend a good amount of time saving up to buy the parts and supplies needed to fix and maintain them, or hunting for them in the world.</p><p>This balancing results in a significantly slower and more difficult progression curve, but it also makes moment-to-moment gameplay more dynamic and engaging, as you'll be driven to explore more thoroughly and be far more thoughtful about the missions and engagements you choose to get involved in. Unlike regular Anomaly, GAMMA's limitations stop you from farming money from easy missions in early locations and buying your way to late-game strength.</p><p>That more patience-driven, methodical pacing is complemented by mods that increase the lethality of gunplay and introduce locational damage, meaning you have to be extremely careful in your approach to firefights (or battles with The Zone's mutants) and contend with wounds to specific limbs and their effects. A broken leg, for example, will prevent you from sprinting.</p><p>Indeed, GAMMA is brutal, and far more hardcore than STALKER's normal open-world gameplay. But it's also ridiculously immersive — the modpack's transformative graphical enhancements help a lot with that — and importantly, <em>fair</em>. With time and experience, you <em>can </em>master its challenges and overcome them, and doing so is immensely satisfying.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rksN8QmYQcJgsredFxsQ4e" name="stalker-gamma-rifle-hero" alt="Official screenshots of STALKER GAMMA on GOG." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rksN8QmYQcJgsredFxsQ4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Progression in STALKER GAMMA is incredibly slow, but also incredibly satisfying. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Grok, STALKER GAMMA author)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Installing GAMMA normally has always been a bit tricky since it requires going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/invite/stalker-gamma" target="_blank">its Discord server</a> and following some lengthy directions, but thanks to the GOG release, it's easier to get playing than it's ever been. However, there <em>is </em>one downside to using GOG to play it.</p><p>That caveat is the fact you have to own either 2010's STALKER: Call of Pripyat or last year's official sequel from GSC Game World, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/stalker-2" target="_blank">STALKER 2</a>, on GOG <em>specifically </em>to download and install STALKER GAMMA. The modpack itself is free, but Call of Pripyat is $20, and STALKER 2 is $59.99 (though the former is discounted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_call_of_prypiat_enhanced_edition" target="_blank">$13.99 at GOG</a> and the latter is down to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" target="_blank">$41.99 at GOG</a> right now).</p><p>I own these games on Steam instead, so I can't use GOG to play GAMMA without buying one of them again — something I'm not going to do. So if you're like me, or you're simply willing to install GAMMA the harder way to avoid spending money, going about it through the modpack's Discord is the way to go.</p><p>Still, it's awesome that this option now exists, and if you already have one of the aforementioned titles on GOG or you're willing to buy one to easily install GAMMA, you can get playing right away.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is STALKER Anomaly and GAMMA safe?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Yes, STALKER Anomaly and the GAMMA modpack for it are both safe to play, and legal.

I'd personally love some kind of story expansion, but that seems unlikely and certainly wouldn't be what the team is referring to right now. <br><br>Avowed first launched back in February 2025, with the game receiving a spring and summer update in response to player feedback.

And in many locations, a 100Whr battery or higher cannot be checked in baggage.</p><p>As such, anyone who owns the AYANEO NEXT II will technically be required to go through this approval process if they want to fly with their handheld, whether or not an airline or TSA security holds you to it.</p><p>Now, I personally always bring a handheld gaming PC when I go on a plane trip since it helps pass the time.

This means that, depending on settings, AYANEO's handheld can take far more power to run, which could deplete the battery very quickly.</p><div><blockquote><p>The NEXT II's APU is more powerful than the Xbox Ally X's, with a CPU that has double the cores and threads.</p></blockquote></div><p>Then there are the NEXT II's dimensions and weight to consider. Given its larger-than-average screen and impressive specs, this device is likely going to be large and weighty.</p><p>As an example, the Legion Go 2's 8.8-inch OLED is considered massive compared to other handhelds, but the NEXT II's display is even bigger at 9.06 inches, so I'm expecting the NEXT II to be fairly large in size and heavy to boot (for a handheld).</p><p>The Xbox Ally X weighs 1.57 pounds (715g), which is somewhat hefty, but it offsets that hand and wrist strain with some of the very best ergonomic grips on a handheld to date. Meanwhile, the Legion Go 2, with its even higher 2.03 pounds (920g), has detachable controllers, so you don't have to hold it. But there's no such relief for the NEXT II.</p><p>Of course, with all that said, I really don't think AYANEO has designed the NEXT II for the average consumer. This is certainly a niche device for PC handheld enthusiasts who are willing to pay a much higher cost for the premium of premium handhelds.</p><p>An official price hasn't been revealed yet, but based on other AYANEO devices, it's very possible it could cost $2,000 or more. So once again, this isn't meant for everyone. But AYANEO said that itself by saying this device is for "True gamers."</p><p>At any rate, I'd be less inclined to travel with such an expensive device when there are other, less expensive handheld gaming PCs available.</p><p>But what do you think about the NEXT II? If price weren't an issue, would you like this handheld?

For reference, the Legion Go 2 has previously had one of the biggest displays, but it's just an 8.8-inch OLED.</p><p>What's more, the NEXT II's display has an extremely high resolution (for a handheld) of up to  2,400 x 1,504. Plus, it can swap between 60Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, and 165Hz, which is higher than most other Windows handhelds out there.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning is the gargantuan battery capacity of 115Whr. For reference, the Xbox Ally X has an 80Whr battery, and the Legion Go 2 has a 74Whr battery, so this really is big. Of course, a handheld's battery life doesn't just depend on capacity, but how efficiently the system runs, so we'll have to wait and see what battery life is actually like for this device.</p><p>Like many other high-end handhelds, this one also packs some premium features, including Hall Effect joysticks and Hall linear triggers, trigger switches, an 8-Way D-Pad for finer control, four back buttons, and a dual-fan cooling system.</p><p>As a fancy extra, it even features an AYANEO RGB name plate that you can apparently customize. Fancy.</p><p>In typical AYANEO fashion, not all of the specs for the NEXT II have been revealed just yet, including the exact ports, connectivity features, and the actual size and weight of the device. As such, we'll have to wait on more announcements in the coming months.</p><p>Additionally, no price or even an expected release date has been revealed. However, given the prices of other high-end AYANEO devices, it's very likely this beast of a handheld could sell for upwards of $2,000, aiming for serious handheld enthusiasts rather than the market at large — thus the marketing for "True gamers."</p><p>In the past, most AYANEO devices have sold at Indiegogo, but some have started appearing at Best Buy as well, so it's possible it could arrive at either location when it finally goes on sale.</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for any updates regarding this beastly AYANEO NEXT II, but what do you think about it?

Fans of indie games on Xbox have also been eating good this month with an absolutely packed roster of new releases to check out. With nearly 80 new titles this month vying for your free time, your new favorite game could be waiting for you. But until you find it, take a moment to look through some of our favorites from November 2025.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-demonschool"><span>Demonschool</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLP5Mv_LfSI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Demonschool doesn’t just dip its toes into the nostalgia pool; it full-on embraces the era that influences it and parades them out for everybody to see. This RPG with tactical battles draws on vintage horror with influences from 70s-era Italian films and classic horror manga to introduce gamers to Faye and her collective of misfit companions.</p><p>Set within a fictional game console, developers Necrosoft Games conceptualized a set of rules and hardware limitations that shaped the game’s story and action. Demonschool challenges players to engage in battles with tactical positioning against some pretty gruesome monsters who can be found in the realm between human and demon worlds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKeWxEBy8RQRrTgot24HP" name="Demonschool-02.jpg" alt="Demonschool promo screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKeWxEBy8RQRrTgot24HP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Slay some demons in this 70s Italian horror inspired tactical RPG, but don't miss your skill-building class. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ysbryd Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Faye and the crew aren’t battling monsters, they’re heading to class to level up their demon-fighting skills, and there are more than 14 characters for players to meet and build relationships.

A cooperative multiplayer game is always a great way to spend time with loved ones, even when distance (or weather) makes being together physically a challenge. HypeTrain Digital’s newest release, Voidtrain, thrusts you and three other cooperative partners into the boots of the crew on an interdimensional express train.</p><p>After stumbling into an all-new world with nothing more than a little trolley and seemingly endless tracks stretching through the void, players have to learn how to explore and survive. As your crew explores floating islands, you’ll be tasked with solving puzzles and combating dangerous creatures.

We've been stuck on 1.21.x for a while, though, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/minecraft/minecraft-copper-age-update-launching-soon">the most recent "The Copper Age" game drop</a> being 1.21.9 for Java Edition and 1.21.110 for Bedrock Edition.</p><p>Under this new system, Minecraft's version number will simply be the year an update is released, followed by additional numbers counting the updates. So, The Copper Age would've been 25.3 for Java Edition and 25.50 for Bedrock Edition (Bedrock Edition's number being higher because that version is simply updated more frequently).</p><p>For patches and hotfixes, Java Edition will get an additional .x increment, and Bedrock Edition will count up from the "0" at the end; for example, 25.3.1 and 25.51, respectively.</p><p>This won't impact the game itself or the player experience at all, but it does streamline matters for developers and creators. It also makes snapshots and previews easier to understand, as they'll now fall under this new version numbering system — instead of something like "25w41a," (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/minecraft/minecrafts-latest-test-lets-you-play-with-spears-zombie-mounts-and-more-starting-today">the first snapshot for the upcoming Mounts of Mayhem game drop</a>), it'd instead be 25.4-snapshot-1.</p><p>These changes will begin taking effect next year (but previews are adopting these changes as soon as next week), so "Minecraft 1.x.x" is officially being retired. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/minecraft/minecrafts-next-big-update-is-officially-less-than-two-weeks-away">The Mounts of Mayhem update is releasing on Dec. 9</a>, and the first update after (in the new year) will be Minecraft 26.1.

The developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/helldivers-2-is-delaying-any-further-new-content-for-now-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing" target="_blank">ultimately chose to delay new content to focus on fixes</a>, and most critical problems were taken care of in the weeks that followed as a result.</p><p>However, one that continued to persist was its bloated file size, which had steadily grown from around 70GB at launch to a whopping 154GB — more than double the original storage requirement, and a serious detriment to our never-ending fight to keep space on our hard drives open. Thanks to a new update, however, that too has finally been taken care of.</p><p>On top of adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-new-helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-has-a-freakin-minigun-in-it-and-also-a-chainsaw-its-got-a-release-date-too-and-im-stoked" target="_blank">the new highly anticipated Python Commandos Warbond</a>, the latest Helldivers 2 patch has shrunk the size of the 154GB co-op shooter down by an incredible 131GB, meaning that it only requires 23GB of space on your drive now. Percentage-wise, that's a full 85% shaved off, which is a better cut than just about everyone was expecting.</p><p>Notably, the PC version of Helldivers 2 has gone from being the largest edition by <em>far </em>to the smallest one, as both the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions of the title presently require about 35-40GB of storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9D5Bmdu4ZxvnqEkGjwNDxg" name="helldivers-2-galactic-emergency-hero" alt="Helldivers 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9D5Bmdu4ZxvnqEkGjwNDxg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Before this new update, Helldivers 2 had a huge PC file size of 154GB; at launch, it was just 70GB. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PlayStation Studios)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Something important to highlight, however, is that this new "slim version" of Helldivers 2 isn't yet the <em>default</em> version. Arrowhead is publicly testing it first before making it the standard, so you have to opt into it yourself.</p><p>This can easily be done by right-clicking Helldivers 2 in your Steam Library, selecting Properties, clicking the Betas tab in the window that appears, and then selecting the "prod_slim" option from the Beta Participation dropdown. Once you do that, the "slim version" patch should download and install, shrinking the game.</p><p>You can also select "prod_legacy" to revert back to the bigger default version if you experience some game-breaking bugs and need to, but hopefully nothing like that happens for anyone. Oh, and Arrowhead notes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" target="_blank">its new blog post</a> that "There are no functional differences between the legacy and slim versions besides the installation size," so don't worry about losing your progression or anything like that.</p><p>Wondering how this was possible? It's because the developers have "de-duplicated" Helldivers 2's assets after duplicating them over time with each update, which was done to help give users of older, slower hard disk drives (HDDs) reasonable loading times that were decently close to what's achievable with speedy and modern solid-state drives (SSDs).</p><p>Arrowhead feared that not doing this would cause HDD loading times to spike by 10 times, but "These loading time projections were based on industry data," and not by testing done with Helldivers 2 itself. The studio found that in reality, "the change in the file size will result in minimal changes to load times — seconds at most."</p><h2 id="a-dream-come-true-for-pc-helldivers-2-players-2">A dream come true for PC Helldivers 2 players</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VFUj9x3EP7CYpVeTsQAWAW" name="helldivers-2-wasp-launcher-team" alt="Two Helldivers using a team reload maneuver in battle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFUj9x3EP7CYpVeTsQAWAW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Keeping Helldivers 2 installed will no longer be difficult for my friends now that it's just over 20GB. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PlayStation Studios)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, this is a dream come true for PC players like me, and guarantees that several of my friends can keep Helldivers 2 installed and at-the-ready at all times. Previously, due to their limited hard drive space, the people I play with often had to uninstall the game to download new ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/battlefield-6" target="_blank">Battlefield 6</a>; now they won't have to, and can enjoy new content updates with me on day one.</p><p>It does seem strange to me that Arrowhead didn't perform tests with Helldivers 2 specifically before deciding to duplicate its assets for the sake of HDD users, especially since it estimated (and later found) that only about 11% of players — a small minority — were using one.</p><p>It's certainly unfortunate that many fans on PC have had to struggle with an unnecessarily bloated file size for months, now, but ultimately, I'm just glad that it's no longer a problem, and that one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-pc-games" target="_blank">best PC games</a> you can play is no longer tough to squeeze into your storage space.</p><p>Haven't signed up for the Galactic War to do your part yet?

During Dell's recent earnings call, the company claimed that approximately <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/nearly-1-billion-pcs-remain-on-windows-10-has-windows-11-adoption-hit-a-wall">500 million PCs could upgrade to Windows 11, but users are hell-bent on sticking to an unsupported operating system,</a> which could make them susceptible to privacy and security nightmares.</p><p>However, there has been an increasing interest in alternative operating systems like Linux, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-10/end-of-10-promotes-linux-for-your-old-pc">a lack of ads and telemetry tracking</a> as the main selling points for the drastic shift.</p><p>Late last month, I reported about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-10/windows-10-retirement-pushes-780-000-users-to-linux-as-zorin-os-hits-1m-downloads" target="_blank">Zorin OS, a Linux distro, gaining approximately 780,000 users from Windows</a>, a little over a month after Microsoft pulled the plug on Windows 10. While this might just be coincidental, the timing is impeccable and could potentially suggest that Microsoft's decision to kill off Windows 10 fueled the transition.</p><p>And as it now seems, Windows losing its user base to Linux-based distros is becoming a popular trend. According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/gaming-first-linux-distro-delivers-a-petabyte-of-isos-in-one-month-as-users-avoid-forced-updates-to-windows-11-bazzite-distro-is-another-safe-haven-for-win-10-refugees">Tom's Hardware</a>, Bazzite gained over a petabyte of ISO downloads in one month.</p><p>Per the outlet's estimations, Bazzite served approximately 150,000 ISOs from October 29 to November 28. The Linux distro site had 730,000 visitors, serving  1PB of data throughout that month.</p><p>The site features a 7.5GB NVIDIA GPU and an AMD GPU-ready 6.6 GB ISO installers. As such, if each installer is presumably 7.0GB per ISO, then that translates to 143,000 Bazzite downloads.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very proud to announce that we've finally pushed past the petabyte barrier and delivered over 1 petabyte of Bazzite ISOs in just the last 30 days.Thank you to everyone that helped make this possible!

Think of it as a SteamOS duplicate but with better hardware compatibility and desktop support. Additionally, it ships with pre-installed drivers for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.</p><p>It also supports non-Steam launchers like Epic Games Store, which makes it easier for users to migrate their game libraries without going through hoops.</p><p>Its recent rise in popularity can be partly attributed to the increasing number of users looking for alternative operating systems to Windows, especially after Windows 10's death and Microsoft's stringent hardware requirements for upgrading to Windows 11.</p><p>Another reason could be the improved compatibility of Windows games on Linux, which can be attributed to Valve's Proton compatibility layer.</p><p>This trend is fueled by users seeking alternatives to Windows, particularly following the end of support for Windows 10 and dissatisfaction with Windows 11’s update policies. The improved compatibility of Windows games on Linux, largely thanks to Valve’s Proton compatibility layer, is a major driving force behind this shift.</p><h2 id="macos-might-be-a-better-alternative-if-you-want-a-basic-user-experience-2">macOS might be a better alternative if you want a basic user experience </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6kgLiakHfLNYvZDtvm6U9D" name="Apple Intelligence on the iPhone .jpg" alt="Apple Intelligence running on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6kgLiakHfLNYvZDtvm6U9D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tom's Guide)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For as long as I can remember, macOS and Windows have been my daily drivers for basic computer stuff. I've never been a PC gamer; consoles like the Xbox Series X just feel more natural and appealing to me.</p><p>But with the end of support for Windows 10, many users seem to be in limbo. However, the emergence of alternative platforms like Bazzite makes things less complicated.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/steam-machine-controller-price-analysis">Valve's Steam Machine</a> is set to ship in the Spring of 2026. Bazzite could serve as a great alternative to SteamOS. SteamOS will wipe an entire drive in your Steam Machine if you don't prepare a partition separately, and perhaps more concerning, the operating system will assume you're using a handheld.</p><p>But this doesn't discount Bazzite as an excellent alternative for handles, as it shows great potential compared to SteamOS across hardware like the ROG Ally.</p><p>As such, if you're looking for an alternative to Windows to support gaming exclusively, then Bazzite or SteamOS are arguably the best alternatives. However, macOS might be a better option if you're looking for a basic computer experience and aren't that much into gaming.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-just-revealed-how-windows-11-is-evolving-into-an-agentic-os-finally-the-explanation-weve-all-been-waiting-for">Microsoft's plans to evolve Windows into an agentic AI OS</a>, Apple could capitalize on the backlash and rip the band-aid off by scrapping <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/will-apple-new-ai-inspire-recall-privacy-pr-nightmare">Apple Intelligence </a>for macOS entirely. It's not like it has made significant headway on that front anyway.</p><p>As our managing editor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-10/i-love-linux-but-it-might-not-be-for-you">Richard Devine puts it</a>, <em>"As good as Linux is, and as much as I might think people should give it a go, for a lot of people it isn't going to be a magic solution when Microsoft turns out the lights on Windows 10." </em></p><p>Devine listed compatibility issues with legacy software as the main deterrent. There was also the issue of identifying the alternative that best suits you from the wide range of Linux-based distros.</p><p><em>What about you? Do you think this time will be any different for Bazzite? Let us know in the comments.</em></p><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE"><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX" name="windows-central-google-news-02" alt="Click to follow Windows Central on Google News" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3AsfTCaaiH29SBi5ptnDX.png" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLggKIihDQklTR0FnTWFoUUtFbmRwYm1SdmQzTmpaVzUwY21Gc0xtTnZiU2dBUAE" target="_blank"><em>Windows Central on Google News</em></a><em> to keep our latest news, insights, and features at the top of your feeds!</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Some clues can be spotted easily, while others will require the aid of party members or tools like Servo Skull Swarms and a terrain analyzer to locate.</p><p>You must be careful when tracking and examining evidence, as some trails may lead to dead ends (where you could literally end up dead) and some evidence may end up being useless red herrings to throw you off.</p><p>So you must carefully decide which clues are worth pursuing and which ones are better left alone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.02%;"><img id="dKitmziDuNNCHfGTCpToyE" name="Warhammer-40000-Dark-Heresy-06" alt="Promotional screenshot of the Detective Journal in Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKitmziDuNNCHfGTCpToyE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Use your Detective Journal to draw conclusions. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Owlcat Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The game will also provide players with a Detective Journal to keep track of the evidence they've collected, use to analyse clues with testimonies from NPCs, and draw conclusions from it to solve active cases.</p><p>Additionally, you can also call upon your party members for aid to help out with analysing clues by offering fresh opinions that could lend credence to conclusions, or use special skills to uncover clues within the clues.</p><p>Be warned, as each clue and testimony could grant you multiple conclusions to draw from, some of which may be false.
